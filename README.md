# Space Mission Launch Analysis Using Tableau

## Project Objective:
To design an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes environmental conditions, launch vehicle data, and mission outcomes from various global space launch sites—enabling users to identify trends, compare agency performance, and explore the impact of site conditions on mission success.

## Dataset:
Space Missions Dataset

## Key Questions Addressed in the Project:

1. 🌡️ Average Temperature Details of Launch Sites

What are the average temperatures recorded at different launch sites?



2. 🌬️ Average Wind Speeds at Launch Sites

What are the typical wind conditions at various launch locations?



3. 💧 Average Humidity at Launch Sites

How does humidity vary across different spaceports?



4. 🚀 Variety of Launch Vehicles by Companies

What different types of launch vehicles are used by different space companies?



5. 📈 Mission Status Overview

What is the mission success rate or failure distribution for each company?



6. 📍 Launch Sites Track Records

How many missions have been conducted from each launch site, and what are their outcomes?

## Project Insight:
In this project, I used Tableau to visualize data from various space mission launches around the world. The dashboard helps us understand:

Which launch sites had higher or lower temperature, humidity, and wind speeds

Which companies (like Boeing, SpaceX, Arianespace) used which launch vehicles

How many missions were successful or failed

Which countries or organizations had the best track records

## Conclusion
This project shows how useful data visualization is for understanding complex information. With the help of Tableau:

We can quickly see trends in space missions

We can compare how different companies and launch sites perform

We can spot possible reasons for mission success or failure (like weather)
